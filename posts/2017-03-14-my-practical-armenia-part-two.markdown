This is part two from the my
first [post](./2017-03-12-my-practical-armenia). 

# Financials

Once in Armenia you'll need to get a feel for the prices and
whatnot. Basically you should need to spend at most 5,000 dram a day,
that's like $11.

```
PRO-TIP: $11 is a slice of pizza and beverage in San Francisco. 
```

I can easily survive on just about 1,500 dram a day and
actually I eat much better than I ever did in America.

Rent should be about at most $300 a month, which I think is quite
fancy and in the city. I spent $250 a month last year during my first
stay in Armenia in a very close to the center, Kentron, part of
Yerevan, keep in mind that outside Kentron the prices are much
cheaper.

You should also make an Armenian bank account, the Armenian financial
system is surprisingly strong, although I suspect at the cost of
massive government debt, and I like using AmeriaBank as they have a
pretty good online banking experience and wire transfers from my
American Chase account only take three days. The local branches are
super efficient and everyone knows Russian, probably English too.

# More cultural observations

If you don't know Armenian, then be prepared to answer why you don't
know Armenian. Everyone will ask why you don't know. 

```
PRO-TIP: Its a legitmate question, why don't you know Armenian?
```

Sign up for an Armenian class ASAP, I really recommend ArmScoop's
class `Armenian as a foreign language` as its intensive, fast paced
and immersive.

```
ANECDOTE: I was outside my Yerevan apartment last
year and an older man started asking me something in Armenian. I
replied in Russian that I didn't know Armenian yet, he then asks
'okay, well where is the local police station?'. I told him I didn't
know that either, to which he said: "You don't know Armenian, you
don't know where the police station is, what are you good for
anyway?"...to which I told him I'm an American Armenian and I moved
here. To that he replied, 'Ah well, good job son, you're a good
person'.ðŸ˜„
```

## You are in a different society

Society in general is quite a bit more conservative, but that doesn't
mean you can't walk around with a mohawk (at least in Yerevan you
could)

that said...

* you can't get shit faced drunk and pee on the station as if it was
  NYC's union square at 2am because the metro is closed after 11pm, a
  real bummer, and someone would probably beat you up.

* You can't walk around yelling profanity or just about anything you
  want, people will shush you.

```
ANECDOTE: I was walking to the metro station on a street 
filled with shopkeepers. In front of me was a mother 
with a child in her arm, kid was on verge of tears but
the mother's soothing kept him just on the 
precipice. As we walked down the street literally every 
shopkeeper pitched in to help keep the kid calm. That would 
never happen in NYC America or SF America, maybe in the
American Southern states.
```

```
PRO-TIP: This is a preferable society.
```

You really feel more connected to other humans and especially as a
Diasporan coming to Armenia proper as you've made a conscious effort
to change the course of this society.

```
PRO-TIP: You will feel very good when you see the 
fruits of your labor.
```

## The only culture shock

Maybe because I grew up in a Russian environment, that is Russian at
home and being a Brooklyn kid, I didn't have all that much culture
shock other than gender relations here which are quite a bit more
conservative than San Francisco, for example, but then again which
society isn't? My biggest culture mismatch mostly related to dating as
its pretty hard to get women to physically meet you and sex before
marriage is mostly a myth, almost a double tragedy is that the girls
here are much prettier than in America and dress on average much
better.

```
PRO-TIP: Your intuitions will be busted, need to adjust.
```

## Effort

So not everything is 100% ideal in Armenia, but for the things I've
lost there's a lot that I gained. 

* Living costs are way cheaper, if you're a programmer you can still
  work Western wages but remotely.

* The food is way better, no need waste $150 going to Whole Foods each
  time.

* The women want families and husbands, culture emphasises family.

* The country is small, talented & technically competent people can
  make changes that rapidly affect many people, you can see the
  results quickly.

* You are living in our ancesteral homeland of 3,000 years and are
  working directly to make it stronger, richer, happier.
